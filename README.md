Welcome to my project
# Question - Answering System

This project aims to build a question-answering system that can respond an answer to a given query or question from users.


1. Data set
   The data set contains 7 columns, we will use the 'id' and the 'article' columns.

2. Set up environment
   First, Python version 3.7.12 is used with Spacy 2.10. To be more specific, you can set up the environment following file requirements_fixed_env.txt for all. 

   Secondly, when deploying on Streamlit, you can follow the file requirements.txt for the set-up environment. However, the results differ between running locally and on Streamlit cloud because of the Spacy version.

3. Training
   In this project, I did not train. Two models used were Sentences Transformer and BERT.
